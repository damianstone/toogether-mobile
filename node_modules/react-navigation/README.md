[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-navigation.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-navigation) [![CircleCI badge](https://circleci.com/gh/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/master) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/contributing.html)

React Navigation is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution based on JavaScript.

## Installation

See: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html

## Documentation

* The best way to learn is to follow the [Getting started guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started.html). It guides you through the fundamentals of React Navigation.
* The documentation includes solutions for common use cases in the "How do I do ...?" section, such as [tab navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation.html) and [Redux integration](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/redux-integration.html).
* If you need to build your own navigator, [there's a section for that](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/custom-navigator-overview.html) too.
* The [API reference](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/api-reference.html) lists all public APIs.
* The [Community Resources](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/blob/master/COMMUNITY_RESOURCES.md) document lists some other resources submitted to us by people who use React Navigation. Feel free to open a pull request to add your resource to the list.
* You can contribute improvements to the documentation [in the website repository](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io).

## Changelog

## FAQs

#### I'm having troubles using the library, what can I do?

See [the help page](https://reactnavigation.org/en/help.html).

#### How can I help?

See our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

#### Is this the only library available for navigation?

Certainly not! There are other libraries - which, depending on your needs, can be better or worse suited for your project. Read more in the [alternative libraries](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/alternatives.html) documentation, and read React Navigation's [pitch & anti-pitch](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/pitch.html) to understand the tradeoffs.

#### Can I use this library for web?

Web support was [not a priority for the 1.0 release](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/2585#issuecomment-330338793), but the architecture of this library allows for it (and it has worked in the past). If you would like to lead this charge, please reach out with your ideas for how to move forward on the [RFCs repository](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs) and we would be happy to discuss.
